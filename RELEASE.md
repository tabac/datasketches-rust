# Release Process for Rust Components

A streamlined release process that relies on CI for validation and focuses on essential manual steps.

## What CI Handles Automatically

CI validates every commit and ensures:

- All tests pass on multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Code passes linting (`cargo x lint`)
- Documentation builds successfully
- Examples run correctly
- MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version) compatibility

## Prerequisites (One-Time Setup)

1. **crates.io access**: `cargo login` and save your API token
2. **GPG setup**: Ensure `gpg-agent` is running and your key is configured
3. **SVN access**: Checkout Apache dist directories:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/apache/dist/{dev,release}/datasketches
   cd ~/apache/dist/dev/datasketches
   svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/datasketches/ .
   cd ~/apache/dist/release/datasketches
   svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/datasketches/ .
   ```

## Step 1: Create Release Candidate Tag

```bash
# Simply tag the current commit as RC
git checkout main
git tag -a 0.3.0-rc.1 -m "Release candidate 1 for 0.3.0"
git push origin 0.3.0-rc.1
```

## Step 2: Publish Release Candidate to crates.io

This allows the community to test the actual published crate.

```bash
# Temporarily change version for RC publish (DON'T commit!)
sed -i '' 's/version = ".*"/version = "0.3.0-rc.1"/' datasketches/Cargo.toml

# Verify package contents
cargo package --list -p datasketches

# Dry run
cargo publish --dry-run -p datasketches

# Publish
cargo publish -p datasketches

# Revert the temporary change
git checkout -- datasketches/Cargo.toml Cargo.lock
```

Verify: Visit https://crates.io/crates/datasketches and confirm `0.3.0-rc.1` is published.

## Step 3: Create Signed Source Distribution

```bash
# Navigate to dist scripts (adjust path as needed)
cd ~/apache/dist/dev/datasketches/scripts

# Run the packaging script (requires GPG)
./bashDeployToDist.sh \
  /path/to/datasketches-rust \
  datasketches-rust \
  0.3.0-rc.1
```

This script will:

1. Create a source archive from the git tag
2. Generate GPG signature (`.asc`)
3. Generate SHA512 checksum (`.sha512`)
4. Upload to https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/datasketches/rust/0.3.0-rc.1/

Verify the files are accessible at the URL above.

## Step 4: Send [VOTE] Email

Send to: dev@datasketches.apache.org

**Subject:** `[VOTE] Release Apache DataSketches Rust 0.3.0 (RC1)`

**Email template:**

```
Hi everyone,

I propose releasing Apache DataSketches Rust version 0.3.0.

Source distribution:
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/datasketches/rust/0.3.0-rc.1/

GitHub tag:
https://github.com/apache/datasketches-rust/releases/tag/0.3.0-rc.1

Testing (choose one or both):
- crates.io RC: cargo add datasketches@0.3.0-rc.1
- From source: Download, verify signatures, cargo x test

To verify signatures:
  ​curl -O https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/datasketches/rust/0.3.0-rc.1/apache-datasketches-rust-0.3.0-rc.1-src.zip
​  curl -O https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/datasketches/rust/0.3.0-rc.1/apache-datasketches-rust-0.3.0-rc.1-src.zip.asc
​  gpg --verify apache-datasketches-rust-0.3.0-rc.1-src.zip.asc

Notable changes: [link to CHANGELOG or summary]

Vote will remain open for at least 72 hours.

[ ] +1 approve
[ ] +0 no opinion
[ ] -1 disapprove (and reason why)
```

**Wait 72+ hours.** Need at least 3 +1 PMC votes and more +1s than -1s.

**If vote fails:**

```bash
# Fix the issues, commit to main, then tag the new RC
git tag -a 0.3.0-rc.2 -m "Release candidate 2 for 0.3.0"
git push origin 0.3.0-rc.2
# Then repeat from Step 2 (with version 0.3.0-rc.2)
```

## Step 5: Close Vote & Publish Release

After successful vote, send [VOTE-RESULT] email summarizing the outcome and proceed to publish the release:

```bash
# Move artifacts from dev to release
cd ~/apache/dist/dev/datasketches/scripts
./moveDevToRelease.sh rust 0.3.0-rc.1 0.3.0

# Update Cargo.toml to final release version (this is the only version commit!)
cd /path/to/datasketches-rust
git checkout main
sed -i '' 's/version = ".*"/version = "0.3.0"/' datasketches/Cargo.toml
git add datasketches/Cargo.toml
git commit -m "chore: release 0.3.0"
git push origin main

# Create final release tag
git tag -a 0.3.0 -m "Release version 0.3.0"
git push origin 0.3.0

# Publish final version to crates.io
cargo publish --dry-run -p datasketches
cargo publish -p datasketches
```

## Step 6: Create GitHub Release

Go to https://github.com/apache/datasketches-rust/releases and draft a new release.

## Step 7: Post-Release Housekeeping

1. **Update website**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/apache/dist/dev/datasketches/scripts
   ./createDownloadsInclude.sh /path/to/datasketches-website
   ```

2. **Clean up old releases** from dist (keep only latest):
   ```bash
   cd ~/apache/dist/release/datasketches
   svn rm rust/0.2.0
   svn commit -m "Archive old release 0.2.0"
   ```

3. **Send [ANNOUNCE] email** after 24 hours (allows mirror propagation):
    - To: dev@datasketches.apache.org, announce@apache.org
    - Include links to: GitHub release, crates.io, docs.rs, Apache dist

---

## Troubleshooting

**Need to yank a crate?**

```bash
cargo yank --vers 0.3.0-rc.1 datasketches
```

Only for broken pre-releases. For released versions, publish a patch instead.

**GPG issues?**

- Ensure key is in KEYS file and uploaded to public keyservers
- Check `gpg-agent` is running: `ps aux | grep gpg-agent`
- Try: `eval $(gpg-agent --daemon)`

**crates.io publish fails?**

- Verify `cargo login` is current
- Check package size: `cargo package --list -p datasketches`
- Ensure all dependencies are published
